#+title: My personal utils

Small housekeeping utilities.

A few tricks and personal rules for Bash are available in these [[file:bash_notes.org][notes]].

I "install" these scripts with [[https://github.com/casey/just][Just]]:

#+begin_src bash
  just install-symlinks
#+end_src

This Just recipe will symlink all scripts to =~/bin=, stripping their
extension.
